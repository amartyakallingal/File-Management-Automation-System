# File-Management-Automation-System
Personal Python script that automatically sends web-downloaded files to custom user-defined folders to avoid cluttering the Downloads folder. Built for scalability: the script can be tweaked to direct files to and from any local directory.

To run the script correctly, install the watchdogs Python package in the terminal using:
```shell
pip install watchdog
```
